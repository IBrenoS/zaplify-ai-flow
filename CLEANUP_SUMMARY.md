# Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully cleaned all microservices logic except infrastructure and scripts directories, leaving only basic functional configuration as requested.

## Services Cleaned

### âœ… API Gateway (services/api-gateway/)

- **Removed**: Complex proxy routing, authentication system, WebSocket support, middleware
- **Preserved**: Basic Express.js setup, health endpoint, logger utility, package.json dependencies
- **Files**: `src/index.ts` (basic Express), `src/routes/health.ts`, `src/utils/logger.ts`

### âœ… AI Service (services/ai-service/)

- **Removed**: Chat routers, models management, embeddings, LangChain integration, middleware
- **Preserved**: Basic FastAPI setup, health endpoint, configuration, package dependencies
- **Files**: `src/ai_service/main.py` (basic FastAPI), `src/ai_service/config.py`, `src/ai_service/routers/health.py`

### âœ… WhatsApp Service (services/whatsapp-service/)

- **Removed**: WhatsAppManager class, Baileys integration logic, media handling, session management
- **Preserved**: Basic Express.js setup, health endpoint, logger utility, package.json dependencies
- **Files**: `src/index.ts` (basic Express), `src/routes/health.ts`, `src/utils/logger.ts`

### âœ… Funnel Engine (services/funnel-engine/)

- **Removed**: FunnelEngine class, automation logic, complex routing, workflow execution
- **Preserved**: Basic Express.js setup, health endpoint, logger utility, package.json dependencies
- **Files**: `src/index.ts` (basic Express), `src/utils/logger.ts`

### âœ… Analytics Service (services/analytics-service/)

- **Removed**: Analytics engine, complex routers (metrics, reports, dashboards, alerts), middleware, database integration
- **Preserved**: Basic FastAPI setup, health endpoint, configuration, package dependencies
- **Files**: `src/analytics_service/main.py` (basic FastAPI with inline config)

## Preserved Components

### ðŸ”’ Infrastructure (Untouched)

- Docker Compose configurations
- Database setup and migrations
- Network and volume configurations
- Environment templates

### ðŸ”’ Scripts (Untouched)

- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `start-dev.bat`
- `start-dev.sh`

### ðŸ”’ Package Dependencies

- All `package.json` files maintained with full dependency lists
- All `pyproject.toml` files preserved with Python dependencies
- TypeScript configurations intact

## Current State

Each service now has:

1. **Basic HTTP server** (Express.js or FastAPI)
2. **Health endpoint** for monitoring
3. **CORS configuration** for development
4. **Basic logging** setup
5. **Clean entry point** ready for development

## Next Steps

The architecture is now ready for focused development with:

- Clean starting points for each microservice
- All necessary dependencies installed
- Infrastructure ready for deployment
- Development scripts available for quick startup

You can now implement specific business logic in each service without the complexity that was previously there.
